 * This datum represents a "room" which is created by the Dungeon Generator process. Whether you use Binary Space Partition(BSP) or Random Room Placement(RRP),

 * this datum to give better control over the data the generator is using. So you can look through the list of rooms for feedback or to understand what's happening.
 * 
 * The datum has procs to construct itself at the given coordinates, and procs to furnish itself according to the randomly assigned "theme" it chooses for itself
