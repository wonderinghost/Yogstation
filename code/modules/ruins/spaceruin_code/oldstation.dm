/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/oldstation/protosuit
	name = "B01-RIG Hardsuit Report"
	info = "<b>*Prototype Hardsuit*</b><br><br>The B01-RIG Hardsuit is a prototype powered exoskeleton. Based off of a recovered pre-void war era united Earth government powered military \
	exosuit, the RIG Hardsuit is a breakthrough in Hardsuit technology, and is the first post-void war era Hardsuit that can be safely used by an operator.<br><br>The B01 however suffers \
	a myriad of constraints. It is slow and bulky to move around, it lacks any significant armor plating against direct attacks and its internal heads up display is unfinished,  \
	resulting in the user being unable to see long distances.<br><br>The B01 is unlikely to see any form of mass production, but will serve as a base for future Hardsuit developments."

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/oldstation/protohealth
	name = "Health Analyser Report"
	info = "<b>*Health Analyser*</b><br><br>The portable K-9 Health Analyser is essentially a handheld variant of a stationary body scanner. Years of research have concluded with this device which is \
	capable of diagnosing even the most critical, obscure or technical injuries any humanoid entity is suffering in an easy to understand format that even a non-trained health professional \
	can understand.<br><br>The health analyser is expected to go into full production as standard issue medical kit."

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/oldstation/protogun
	name = "K14 Energy Gun Report"
	info = "<b>*K14-Multiphase Energy Gun*</b><br><br>The K14 Prototype Energy Gun is the first energy rifle that has been successfully been able to not only hold a larger ammo charge \
	than other gun models, but is capable of swapping between different energy projectile types on command without malfunction.<br><br>The weapon still suffers several drawbacks, such as the fact its non-lethal, \
	'taser' fire mode can only fire one round before exhausting the energy cell. It also remains prohibitively expensive to produce, nonetheless NT Market Research fully believe this weapon \
	will form the backbone of our energy weapon catalogue.<br><br>The K14 is expected to undergo revision to fix the ammo issues, and the K15 is expected to replace the 'taser' setting with a \
	lower-power version of the laser setting (designed to disorient on contact) in an attempt to bypass the ammo issues."

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/oldstation/protosing
	name = "Singularity Generator"
	info = "<b>*Singularity Generator*</b><br><br>Modern power generation typically comes in two forms, a Fusion Generator or a Fission Generator. Fusion provides the best space to power \
	ratio, and is typically seen on military or high security ships and stations, however Fission reactors require the usage of expensive, and rare, materials in its construction.. Fission generators are massive and bulky, and require a large reserve of uranium to power, however they are extremely cheap to operate and oft need little maintenance once \
	operational.<br><br>The Singularity aims to alter this, a functional Singularity is essentially a controlled Black Hole, a Black Hole that generates far more power than Fusion or Fission \
	generators can ever hope to produce - assuming its containment systems remain operational."

//terminal formatting is really weird and its just copypasted /tg/ code so idk how to fix it lmao
//advice for anyone else who deals with it: either fix it to use whatever paper uses or **DO NOT** TRY TO FORMAT IT!
//PLEASE I FUCKING BEG YOU EITHER FIX IT OR DONT TRY TO OR ITLL BE FUCKING HELL ON EARTH
