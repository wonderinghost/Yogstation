	info = {"I'm at the end now.<BR>
Many days and many nights have passed since I left our sanctuary across the isles.
They gave me this crystal, and told me it would be the key to exposing <i>it</i>, the source of our world's cancer.<BR><BR>

Now, I see the altar they spoke of, and its misshapen! The lock is too wide, too deep. And there I realized it doesn't fucking fit!
It wasn't a key, it was a SHARD. I risked my life for this! Traveled half the world just for a fucking fragment? And for what? To die here, alone?<BR><BR>

This is it. My flask ran dry days ago. I could carry on, but I'm far too weak and too far to go back.<BR>
If any of you find this, I'm so sorry. I failed you all.<BR>
