		cybernetics encased in a plasteel shell. Now left to their own devices among the forgotten ruins of their old civilization, \

		"Preterni were built by the Vxtrin to work in hazardous environments with minimal monitoring. Combining \
		the durability of metal with the versatility of organic matter, preterni worked in factories, engines, \
		and research facilities, enduring radiations, toxins, and extreme temperature- similarly to the silicon \
		units of this time, while able to adapt and improvise when faced with new problems and changing environments.",

		"Approximately seventeen millennia ago, the entire Vxtrin population disappeared along with the preterni, \
		leaving only deactivated factories and abandoned facilities. The first preternis factory was reactivated by \
		accident in 2431 by SIC colonists on the planet of Ur'lan. Communication between the newly-created preterni \
		and the colonists was made possible by the silicon units built using the MMI technology that had been uncovered \
		previously in Vxtvul ruins. Upon hearing of the discovery of preterni on Ur'lan, Nanotrasen immediately \
		bought the property of the colony for more than a thousand time its original value and attempted to claim \
		the preterni as their property. The scheme was unsuccessful and preterni formed the Remnants of Vxtvul as \
		a unifying government",

		"The SIC decided it was best if preterni and humanity worked together to uncover the secrets of the Vxtrin. \
		While SIC authorities desired an alliance, several groups and companies pillaged or sabotaged Vxtvul ruins \
		before the preterni could recover them, destroying hardware and stealing technologies. Such acts outraged \
		the Remnants and have led to great tension between them and the SIC. Using Vxtvul technology, the preterni \
		developed a navy and ground military forces to defend their ruins from scavengers, and while humans are \
		accepted among Remnant territories and stations, they are monitored constantly.",

		"Preterni strive for excellence and tend to be extremely work-focused. They tend to be slightly distrustful \
		of humans and prefer to rely on themselves for any important task. As silicon units are derived from Vxtrin \
		technology, preterni tend to have some affection and respect for them, even though silicon lawsets can mean \
		these relationships are one-sided.",

		"Preternis culture was lost for the most part along with their masters. Current customs involve was recovered \
		through archeological works, perpetuated in remembrance of the golden age when Vxtrin were still with them, \
		then combined with human practices that have been adopted due to the species' proximity to humanity. \
		Preterni have no hair naturally, but many have installed synthetic hairs on their head to better \
		differentiate themselves and mimic humans.",

		"The SIC and the Remnants are still wary of each others, but they nonetheless exchange goods, \
		and travel between the two empire is relatively unhindered. Preterni can be seen working in SIC \
		space, often hired to work in hazardous environments. Some join exploration crews and travel to far \
		away facilities in the hopes of stumbling upon ruins of their fallen empire.",
